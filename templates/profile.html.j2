  Your Skyward password is not stored on the server, only a session
  token that you can revoke by logging into Skyward again. In other words,
  Skyward Updater does not have direct access to your account, it only
  has access by a sort of ID badge that you can destroy at any time
  by logging into your Skyward account manually. <i>If you want to
  remain logged in, do not log into your Skyward account manually.</i>
  To visit Skyward while also remaining logged in, click
  <a href="/skyward">here.</a>

        To find your Skyward Service, go to the Skyward link for your school and
        copy/paste the portion <i>after</i> "WService=" but before the "/".
      </h3>
      <h2>
        As an example, here's the Skyward link for OPRFHS.
        <span>https://skyward.iscorp.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=wseduoakparkrfil/fwemnu01.w</span>
        the part after "WService=" is "wseduoakparkrfil/fwemnu01.w" and the part
        before the "/" is "wseduoakparkrfil" so that would be the service.
      </h2>
